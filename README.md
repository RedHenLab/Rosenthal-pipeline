# Rosenthal-pipeline
Processing digitized files on HPC
These scripts run on Hoffman2, a shared cluster. They monitor one or more remote file servers for freshly digitized files.
When files are detected, the scripts request compute nodes and transfer the files for repair, text extraction, and compression.
